# Taxonomy-based information content and wordnet-wiktionary-wikipedia glosses for semantic relatedness

---

This paper proposes two methods based on knowledge-structure and knowledge-content respectively. Firstly, based on structure, this paper proposes a new instristic Information Content(IC) computing method which is based on the quantification of the subgraph formed by the ancestors of the target content. Sencondly taking knowledge content into consideration, this paper proposes a gloss-based semantic similarity measure that operates based on the noun weighting mechanism using the IC-computing method based on structure with WordNet, Wiktionary and Wikipedia resources. 

Notes:

- The 'is-a' taxonomy can be modeled as a Directed Acyclic Graph(DAG).
- SS/SR measures can be evaluated using correlation coefficients to correlate the scores computed by a measure with the judegments provide by humans in different datasets.[p21]
