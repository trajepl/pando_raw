# Evaluating WordNet-based Measures of Lexical Semantic Relatedness
---

This paper evaluates some kinds of measures  of lexical semantic relatedness based on wordnet in 2005. 
- Lexical resource–based approaches to measuring semantic relatedness
    - Dictionary-based approaches
    - Approaches based on Roget-structured thesauri
    - Approaches using WordNet and other semantic networks
    - Computing taxonomic path length
    - Scaling the network
        - Sussna’s depth-relative scaling
        - Wu and Palmer’s Conceptual Similarity
        - Leacock and Chodorow’s Normalized Path Length
    - Information-based and integrated approaches
        - Resnik’s information-based approach
        - Jiang and Conrath’s combined approach
        - Lin’s universal similarity measure

Notes:
- semantic relatedness | semantic similarity | semantic distance
- when the paths are restricted to IS-A links, the shortest path length does measure conceptual distance


English expression:
- notwithstanding
- We would thus have very much preferred to be able to adhere to
