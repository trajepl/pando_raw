# Computing Semantic Relatedness using Wikipedia-based Explicit Semantic Analysis

---

## Motivation
- Prior works on semantic relatedness was based on purely statistical techniques that did not make use of background knowledge [Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999; Deerwester et al., 1990], or lexical resources that incorporate very limited knowledge about the world. [Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006; Jarmasz, 2003].
- So the paper propose Explicit Semantic Relatedness(ESA), for fine-grained semantic representation of unrestricted natural language text.

## Related work
- Lexical databases such as WordNet [Fellbaum, 1998] or Rogetâ€™s Thesaurus [Roget, 1852] encode relations between words such as synonymy, hypernymy. Quite a few metrics have been defined that compute relatedness using various properties of the underlying graph structure of these resources [Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006; Jarmasz, 2003; Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003; Resnik, 1999; Lin, 1998; Jiang and Conrath, 1997; Grefenstette, 1992]

- Budanitsky and Hirst [2006] argued that the notion of relatedness is more general than that of similarity, as the former subsumes many different kind of specific relations, including meronymy, antonymy, functional association, and others.

- Budanitsky and Hirst [2006] also argued that the notion of semantic distance might be confusing due to the different ways it has been used in the literature.

1. be inspired by the desire to ...
2. massive amounts of 
3. be grounded in
4. Observe that
5. Semantic relatedness indicates how much two concepts are related in a taxonomy by using all relations between them (i.e. hyponymic/hypernymic,meronymic and any kind of functional relations including has-part, is-made-of, is-anattribute-of, etc.). When limited to hyponymy/hyperonymy (i.e. is-a) relations, the measure quantifies semantic similarity instead.
