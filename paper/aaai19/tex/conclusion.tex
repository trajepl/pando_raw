\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we focus on computing semantic relatedness to get an approximation to human judgement.
We utilize the Knowledge Graph DBPedia which is derived from Wikipedia as background knowledge to construct
a knowledge association network. To measure the word semantic relatedness, we consider three kinds of relationships
which consist of  word-to-word, word-to-entity and entity-to-entity, and we adopt two difference models to capture
the semantic of attributes and topology structure instead of fixed score functions in our network.
The experiments based on golden dataset show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art models in semantic relatedness measurement.
