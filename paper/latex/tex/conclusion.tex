\section{Conclusion}
In this paper we focus on computing semantic relatedness getting an approximation to human judgement.
We utilize the Knowledge Graph DBPedia which is derived from wikipedia as the background knowledge.
For an input pairwise word, we will get two sets of corresponding entities in DBpedia.
Then we propose a model for extracting a subgraph which contains complete information surrounding two set of entities from DBPedia.
Then we use a model of knowledge graph embedding to train the subgraph generating high-dimensional vector for each entity and relation. 
Finally, we get multiple relatedness scores after a join between two set of entities.
In order to better fit the judgement of human, we utilize a weighted strategy to combine
multiple relatedness scores of pairwise entities.
The experiments based on golden dataset for computing semantic relatedness show
that our model outperform the state-of-the-art model.
