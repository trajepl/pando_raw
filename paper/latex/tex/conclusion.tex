\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we focus on computing semantic relatedness to get an approximation to human judgement.
We utilize the Knowledge Graph DBPedia which is derived from wikipedia as background knowledge.
For an input pairwise word, we get two sets of corresponding entities from DBpedia.
Then we propose a model to extract a subgraph which contains complete information surrounding two sets of entities.
We use a model of knowledge graph embedding to train the subgraph and generate high-dimensional vector for each entity and relation. 
Finally, we get multiple relatedness scores after a full link between two sets of entities.
In order to better fit the judgement of human, we utilize a weighted strategy to combine
multiple relatedness scores. The experiments based on golden dataset show that our model
outperforms the state-of-the-art model in semantic relatedness measurement.
