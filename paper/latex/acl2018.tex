  \begin{abstract}
    In this paper, we propose a model to compute semantic relatedness with the benefit of knowledge graph
    such as DBPedia.
    As the filiation of DBPedia, the wikipedia provides a so broad information coverage that many researches which
    are based on wikipedia for computing semantic relatedness have obtained accurate results. However the wikipedia-based
    methods usually require a significant preprocessing. In order to avoid the burden of preprocessing, some researchers
    consider to utilize DBPedia to compute semantic relatedness. These researches
    achieve great results which are on par with wikipedia-based methods. However, some of information in knowledge graph
    is missed in the DBPedia-based researches. To get an approximation to human relatedness judgement, we propose a method which
    utilizes the comparison of entities in knowledge graph to simulate semantic relatedness between words.
    The experiment based on gold dataset shows that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art model in semantic relatedness measurement.
