\begin{abstract}
  In this paper we focus on computing semantic relatedness getting an approximation to human judgement.
  We use the Knowledge Graph(DBpedia) which is derived from wikipedia as the background knowledge.
  Then we use knowledge graph embedding to generate high-dimensional vector representing corresponding
  entities. For an input pairwise word, we get two sets of corresponding entities in DBpedia, resulting multiple
  relatedness scores after a join between two set of entities.
  In order to better fit the judgement of human, we propose a combinatorial strategy to combine
  multiple relatedness scores of pairwise entities.
  The experiments based on golden dataset for computing semantic relatedness show
  that out model perform the state-of-the-art model.
