  \begin{abstract}
    In this paper, we focus on computing semantic relatedness to get an approximation to human judgement.
    We utilize the Knowledge Graph(DBPedia) which is derived from wikipedia as background knowledge.
    For an input pair of words, we get two sets of corresponding entities in DBpedia.
    Then we propose a model to extract a subgraph which contains complete information surrounding two sets of entities from DBPedia.
    We use a method of knowledge graph embedding to train the subgraph to generate high-dimensional vector for each entity and relation. 
    Finally, we get multiple relatedness scores after a full link between two sets of entities.
    In order to better fit the judgement of human, we utilize a weighted strategy to combine
    multiple relatedness scores of pairwise entities.
    The experiment based on gold dataset shows that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art model in semantic relatedness measurement.
