applications of semantic relatednes: 
    natural language processing (NLP), word sense disambiguation , 
    synonym detection, named entities recognition, semantic relations extraction, question answering systems 

linguistically structured (e.g. WordNet) and collaboratively developed knowledge bases (e.g.Wikipedia), among others.

The dimensions of the proposed framework cover three main aspects of SR approaches including the resources they rely on, 
the computational methods applied on the resources for developing a relatedness metric, and the evaluation models that 
are used for measuring their effectiveness.(Agirre et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2009),

Formally speaking, semantic relatedness (SR) is defined as a form of semantic or functional associations between two words
rather than just lexical relations such as synonymy and hyponymy (Budan & Graeme, 2006).

the 14 selected methods utilize a wide range of knowledge resources that have been proposed for SR calculation such as 
Wikipedia, Web search engines, ontologies and Wiktionary, to name a few.
